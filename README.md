# Project Name - Random Cat Meme Generator
Following on my advice of fellow studnts, and cohort leads, I have decided to create something that i'm passionate about, and will also hopefully make a change to a persons day. Step in, randomc cat meme generator. As an avid cat lover, I am aware of the joy and happiness these furry creature can bring to a persons day. Therefore, I have decided there is nothing i'd rather do for my first project than dedicate the honor to cats and also memes.
